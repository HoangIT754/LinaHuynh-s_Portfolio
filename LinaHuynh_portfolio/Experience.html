					<h3 class="major">Data Analyst | Job Ready Master</h3>
					<p>As a Data Analyst at Job Ready Master since October 2023, I excel in extracting and manipulating
						data from intricate
						datasets using SQL. Utilizing Tableau and Power BI, I conduct thorough analysis, generating
						actionable insights and
						visualizations. Moreover, I deliver automated reports to assess business performance and suggest
						system enhancements.
						Additionally, I specialize in building dashboards, reports, and visualizations to provide
						valuable insights and

					<h3 class="major">Study Adviser | Tafe SA</h3>
					<p>As a Study Adviser at Tafe SA since April 2023, I offer comprehensive weekly consultations to
						more than 20 students,
						addressing various study skills such as organization, digital proficiency, and question
						interpretation. Through engaging
						with students, I identify learning barriers and areas for enhancement in educational delivery,
						including learning
						management systems and student services. Additionally, I review and evaluate student support
						strategies, implementing
						improvements such as online assessment feedback and after-hour counseling to ensure optimal
						learning experiences.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Capstone Professional Project | Courts Administration Authority (CAA) SA</h3>
					<p>From July 2023 to November 2023, I spearheaded a Capstone Professional Project at the Courts
						Administration Authority
						(CAA) SA. This project involved investigating the application of Software as a Service (SaaS) in
						CAA's Electronic
						Document Records Management System (EDRMS). I conducted a comprehensive cost analysis comparing
						three models of running
						EDRMS: on-premise, hybrid, and cloud-based solutions. The insights gained from this analysis led
						to critical
						recommendations for management, potentially shifting strategic direction and achieving a 30%
						increase in cost
						efficiency.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Strategy & Planning Analyst â€“ Data Analyst | Lazada Vietnam</h3>
					<p>During my tenure as a Strategy & Planning Analyst and Data Analyst at Lazada Vietnam from April
						2021 to February 2022, I
						played a pivotal role in developing and analyzing real-time dashboards and automated reports for
						operational management,
						spanning sales, finance, and marketing. This initiative resulted in a significant 40% reduction
						in decision-making time.
						Furthermore, I gathered and validated data to track application KPIs, identifying and resolving
						ad-hoc business issues,
						leading to a 25% improvement in application responsiveness. </p>

					<p>I also monitored user behavior on applications and external sources to uncover trends and areas
						for business
						improvement, contributing to a tactical 24-hour campaign that doubled user engagement.
						Additionally, I led 6 to 8
						projects annually with cross-functional teams, driving initiatives focused on user and buyer
						growth, including gaming,
						live streaming, and search optimization. </p>

					<p>My efforts contributed to leading cluster in-app performance metrics to achieve an average annual
						growth rate of 1.5 to
						2.2 times. Notably, successful feature launches in gaming led to a threefold increase in
						platform followers following
						quarterly campaigns. For these accomplishments, I was honored with the Company Quarterly
						Operation Excellence award.</p>

					<h3 class="major">Graduate Program | Lazada Viet Nam</h3>

						was selected as one of
						the top 1% of candidates for this intensive 24-month training program. This program was designed
						for fast-track career
						acceleration in e-commerce, featuring project rotations across various functions.</p>
					<p>During the program, I undertook several key projects:</p>
